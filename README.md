<h1> CheatSheet </h1>

Pretty cheat sheets, or \`\`reference cards'', obtainable from Org files.

**The listing sheet, as PDF, can be found [here](https://github.com/alhassy/CheatSheet/blob/master/CheatSheet.pdf)**, while below is a quick-n-dirty html rendition.

# Hello, World!

-   **Pretty PDF:** Enter `M-x compile` to produce a nice looking PDF of your reference sheet.
    -   I've bound this command to `C-c C-m` in my Emacs setup ;-)

-   **Section Headers:** A usual Org header, say `* my section`, results in the boxed headers
    used in this cheat sheet.

-   **Parallel Environments:** The sequence `<p TAB` produces a \`parallel' environment for
    producing text side-by-side. The column break is automatic, but as 
    this is sugar for a `minipage` containing a `multicolum` we can force a column
    separation with `\columnbreak`: This command, in Org, necessities newlines between
    the items being separated.

# CheatSheet Examples

Reference sheets created from this project include,
\vspace{1em}

-   **[LatticesCheatSheet](https://github.com/alhassy/LatticesCheatSheet):** Reference sheet for definitions and results in Lattice Theory.

-   **[CoqCheatSheet](https://github.com/alhassy/CoqCheatSheet):** Reference sheet for the Coq language.

\vspace{1em}
The steps to utilising this git project for your own cheat sheet may be:

1.  Go to the repo you want to make a cheat sheet.
2.  Add this project as a submodule then copy its core to where you're working:
    
        git submodule add https://github.com/alhassy/CheatSheet.git
        ; cp CheatSheet/CheatSheet.org . 
        ; cp CheatSheet/README.org .
3.  Open `CheatSheet.org` and locate `#+INCLUDE: CheatSheetSetup.org`
    then rewrite `CheatSheetSetup.org ‚Ü¶ CheatSheet/CheatSheetSetup.org`.
4.  Within the `README.org`, if you're using it, alter the regions marked
    `!!CHANGE ME!!`.

I don't think this is difficult to automate, so I will likely get
to doing it.

# Org-mode Basics

Read [Org-mode for beginners](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html) for a refresher!

-   For more see [The Compact Org-mode Guide](https://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf).

\vspace{1em}

-   **Reloading:** To reload a file with updated org settings, press
    `C-c C-c` on a settings line &#x2013;i.e., one beginning with a `#+`, to reset the 
     temporary file cache.

-   **Inclusion:** During export, you can include the content of another file. 
    -   Syntax: `#+INCLUDE: "‚ü®fileName‚ü©" [‚ü®markup‚ü© [‚ü®language‚ü©]]`
        -   `markup ::= src | example`
        -   `language ::= C | haskell | emacs-lisp | ‚ãØ`
        -   If the markup is not given, the text will be assumed to be in 
            Org mode format and will be processed normally; c.f., [Setup files](https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-settings.html).
    
    -   To visit the file, `C-c '` while the cursor is on the line with the file name.
    
    -   Include only portions of a file by appending with `:lines "x-y"` where `x` is the first
        line and `y` is the second-to-last line. Also `"-y"` for upto but not including line `y`,
        and `"x-"` for taking line `x` until the end of the file.

# Emacs

-   **C-x r k   :** M-x kill-rectangle
-   **C-l C-l   :** move buffer top to be current cursor location.
-   **Delete a region of text, e.g., white space:** `C-SPC` at the beginning of the first line
    then `C-x r k` (rectangular kill) at the end of the last line of the (indentation) region you want to remove.


<a id="orgad02220"></a>

# Git

-   **Revert a file to a particular commit:** `git checkout 0cdf -- myfiles`
    -   Where `0cdf` is your commit identifier, which is usually much longer.

-   **`git whatchanged`:** Like `git log` but informs exactly which files were altered.


<a id="org55fd941"></a>

# Grep

-   **Find all files containing specific text:** \forcenewline
    \`r'ecursively look for the \`w'hole given pattern:   
    `grep -rw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'`

-   **Better:** `ack 'text-to-find-here' locationToBeginLooking`
    -   [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) is like grep, but for source code.
    -   It looks prettier and more informative.

# Linux

-   The way to \`\`double-click'' on a file from the command line is `xdg-open`.

# CheatSheet Helper Elisp

The following utilities are loaded when this file is opened.
After the first time the file `CheetSheet.el` is created and this section
may be deleted. When you delete this section, ensure the `load` in the footer
below loads `CheatSheet/CheatSheet.el`.

1.  Make some changes, look at them with `f7`.
2.  Commit each change with `f8`.
3.  Push your changes with `f9`.

# (EXAMPLE USAGE OF `<p`) [Loops implement finite quantifications](https://frama-c.com/)

A finite quantification can be defined axiomatically
by the empty-range rule and split-off term rules.
Together these form a recursive definition which can be phrased as a loop.

<div class="parallel">


    // For -‚äï- : ùëª ‚Üí ùëª ‚Üí ùëª,
    // fold(A,a,b) ‚âà (‚äï x : a..b-1 ‚Ä¢ A[x]) 
    /*@ axiomatic Fold { 
      @   
      @ logic ùëª
      @   fold{L}(ùëª *A, integer a, integer b)
      @   reads a,b,A, A[..] ;
      @
      @ axiom foldEmptyRange{L} :
      @   \forall ùëª *A, integer a, b; a >= b
      @   ==>  fold(A,a,b) == identity(‚äï);
      @
      @ axiom foldSplitOffTerm{L} :
      @   \forall ùëª *A, integer a, b; a <= b
      @   ==>     fold(A, a, b+1) 
      @        == fold(A, a, b  ) ‚äï A[b];
      @ }
      @*/

\columnbreak

    /*@ requires \valid(A+(0..N-1));
      @ assigns \nothing;
      @ ensures \result == fold(A,0,N);
      @*/
    ùëª fold(int N, ùëª* A) {
    
        ùëª total = identity(‚äï);
        
        /*@ loop invariant 0 <= n <= N;
          @ loop invariant total == fold(A,0,n);
          @ loop assigns n, total;
          @ loop variant N-n;
        */
        for(int n = 0; n != N; n++)
            total = total ‚äï A[n];
        return total;
    }

</div>

This pseudo-code is reified by giving concrete values
for `(ùëª, ‚äï, identity)` such as `(int, +, 0)` or `(bool, ||, false)`.
Any [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) will do.
